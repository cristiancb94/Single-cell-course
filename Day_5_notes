The transcriptome has over-merging of the genes
  The mapping should be 
  Busco- search for universal single copy orthologs (They do not have paralogs)
  Technical replicate-> same sample treated twice
  Biological replicate -> Different samples

#Principal components analysis
PCA will scale the data in order to find the best conformation in which the data is best spread. 

When find the angle, you can trace a line that at the end will explain the variance of the data.

PCA will not reduce the dimensions
  Will rank the components

We need the columns to be the genes and the rows should be the libraries

##Functional annotation of genes

Comparison with large biological databases
Primary -GenBank (Use blast)
         ENA
  Composite
        Uniprot       
Secondary -Pfam  (Conserved patterns) - Use hidden markov models
          -Interpro

Specialized OrthoDB
            Kegg 
            Interaction
Tools (primary) - Blast / Diamond 
Tools (secondary) - probabilities (HMMER tool)

Functional annotation
  InterproScan
  Eggnogmapper

They need the protein sequence
###Steps Extract transcriptome###
         Extract coding sequences
         Extract protein sequences 

## Running GFF3
Will extract what you tell it to extract from a genome using 
-x write a fasta file with spliced reads for each GFF
-w write a fasta file with spliced transcripts 
#To retrieve sequences of transcriptome
gffread -g /scratch/course/2023w300106/barrera/test1/ncbi_dataset/data/GCF_932526225.1/GCF_932526225.1_jaNemVect1.1_genomic.fna  -w transcripts_1.fasta  /scratch/course/2023w300106/barrera/test1/ncbi_dataset/data/GCF_932526225.1/genomic.gff
#To retrieve proteins.fasta -but it will assume an standard translation
  #Wil produce it only if it contains the CDS information 

For this reasons you have to look now the longest ORF for the protein coding mRNA, some of them may be not coding.
We are chosing from TRANSDECODER the longest ORF  

Map to pfam
--retain_pfam_hits
--retain_blastp_hits
--single_best_only
  The results of those analysis have to be done before 

Assesing mapping tool
Contiguity fragmentation N50 NG50 AuN curve - It is important but is not the only measurement
Coherence -> Whatever resources I use for the assembly they make sense for this assembly (I have to map 90% of my reads to the assembly)
             The reads should map in the opposite strand
             The average lenght of the mapped reads should be coherent
Completeness: ESTs, CDS and download to map to your genes, RNAseq, proteins + (Busco) they should be there
Correctness 
##Contiguity
Depends on technology
  1st generation limited to gerarchical assembly (700 bp/read)
  2nd generation Pyro and illumina sequencing (short reads~300bp /reds) random sequence any part of the DNA -overlapping sequences-whole genome shotgun
  3nd Generate long reads on average (3-4kb - 20 kb) PacBio || Nanopore (1000000)  They have high quality

Hierarchical shotgun
  BAC library ( fragmentation of the DNA)
  Fingerprinting and doing a minimum tiling path based on the restriction map of the BAC clones
    Then you have to do subclones and sequence fragments 
##Second generation
  Production of a lot of reads that may overlap
  Scaffolding is based in the forward and reverse sequence of reads from different contigs that could collapse together
Coherence
There should be a match between the kmer distribution and the assembly
2C value correspond to the diploid genome
Flow citometry can over stimate 

## Coherence
  Reads should be mapping in both directions to ensure the quality of the genome
#Completeness
Assembly reads
RNA-seq 
EST
Busco (The more missing the more incomplete it is), it could be view as a proportion of the missing total
