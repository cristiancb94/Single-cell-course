 -----------------------------------------------------------------

Reference genome or transcriptome
	DNA sequence of the organism
	Does not represent the diversity, give 99% of genes and regulatory elements that you need to analyze
		To compare all samples against different genomes to reduce the computational costs
		Reference genomes are biased

		Gene structure
			coding - exons
			not coding -introns

		Genome annotation
			Assing coding regions to the genome
			Does not tell what the genes are for - blast (functional annotation) - Foldseq to compare topology

		##Reference transcriptome
			Extract RNA and assembly a map of expressing regions
			You do not have the intergenic regins and the regulatory elements
			RNA-seq has different sequencing depth, some genes may be duplicated (alternative isoformns)
				20.000 genes -human  60.000 transcripts- humans

			Mapping rate is lower because it can not determine to which place the read should be mapped.
				(Problem associated to cellranger)
				(Reduce duplication rate)

		Where to get the genomes https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/genome/?taxon=10090
			When downloading the transcripts you also download the UTR regions from the genome

		To get a close organism ncbi taxonomy browser

	Simbionts - mapping against a compound reference will avoid over-counting the reads from the "parasite", "host"

	Where to retrieve transcriptomes

Lisc- applications
	#Modules all packages needed
	sratoolkit - download from ncbi
	module help 
	module avail *blast*

   Programs that are complicated to install are under conda environments

   Minimap 
   Mapping RNA-seq to PacBio reads

   Samtools
   Explore genomic data

   Mapping reads from the .sam file 
   From the mapped reads you get a .sam file which you also can index to retrieve the exons that you may be interest in

Main formats
	All are text files (Use text editor)
	Fasta Has sometimes descriptors separated with "|" but better is separated with "spaces"
	Fastq High a quality score assigned to letters. The higher the quality the better. The lowest score is for files that are "NNNN"
	GFF/GTF (General feature columns) - Col 1 is the chromosome
										Col 2 is the source
										Col 3 type "gene" appears first, then "transcripts" wich have a different subsets of exons, CDS are part of the exons 
										Can be there exons without coding sequence
											ATG-Start CDS
											UAG-Stop codon // The remaining sequence of this exon is UTR
										Col 8 phasing-> only apply to CDS  For every sequence 6 sequences, 
	SAM
Mapper
	Regularly you will use a short read mapper
		RNA-seq may have introns you need GAP aligner - STAR
	Why are we doing this- We want to do pairwise alignment of the 150 bp sequences
						   Generating an index will make things easier assinging a characteristic region (k-mer) for map 

		R1 is reverse
		R2 is forward

We can use the RNA mapping to generate such a file that infers the positions of the genes 
 The best evidence for an exon is to have splited reads which means that theere is an intron in between thats why ou need OutSAMstrandfield (Need to review the function of this one)
GTF files which contains Gene coordinates /exon coordinates

##Day 2
	Mapping wil find the best location for the short reads
	Average input read lenght is pairing the (R1 and R2) that is the reason for the 301
	Uniquely mapped reads->reads that did not match in more than one place of the genome 58.65%
	Splices -Sequences of RNA splitted in two different regions (check)

	Multi-mapping reads
	Reads that were found in several regions of the reference. They may be related to duplications 
	Sequencing errors can affect the assignation of the reads 
		Up to 5 loci is considered mapped to multiple loci
		If it goes beyond 5 loci is considered mapped to too many places
	These multi-mapping can not be assigned to a specific origin, then they can not be used

	Unmapped reads
	-Too short
	-Quality of the whole (300bp)

	How to fix
		-Quality trimming 
		-Remove adapters
		-Use single end (individual reads)

	If you have more than 10 million uniquely mapped you can continue (human_genomics -	25k genes
		Having 10 million reads will allow to achieve enough coverage of the genes in order to perform statistical analysis of counts

Why we align
	Pair-wise alignment (finding the best possible alignment)
	Short sequence to long sequence (Local alignment)
	Alignment that accounts for introns //  (Gap alignment)-> Open up the query

		Mapping RNA-seq to the transcriptome (processed mRNA does not have introns) do not need the GAP alignment

	Normal Single-Cell target the end of the exon(?), this may be problematic for long genes
To rank and cluster sequences depending on the similarity
	Comparing two individuals (looking for which regions are more smilar within the librares)

Alignment
	Index
	QC reads - Remove adapters / low quality reads 
	Alignment
		Short reads < 400bp bowtie
		Long reads > 500 minimizer minimap2, fast*
		Spliced reads -> If the reads need to be spliced they come from RNA-seq
			They produce a SAM file
	

	QC alignment
		Multimappers are usually discarded
		Aligners when they find a position, they also assing a probability of being wrong. (Comparing the ratio of the best to the second best, the larger the difference the better is the alingment)
		Retain alignments that are informative

Tools to aling 
	Ungapped -microRNA / whole genome shot-gun.
	Short 
		Bowtie1- short reads
		Bowtie2- for reads below 500 bp
	Gapped Expressed sequences / However if mapping to a transcriptome then you do not need this / useful when mapping RNA-seq to the reference genome
	Short
		Star
		HiSat2


	Pacbio reads to a genome (aligning long reads-even chromosomes)
	Minimap2
 	
 	Counting the number of Isoforms for every gene model that were created from mapping the RNA-seq reads
 	Trinity- construct a graph based on k-mer plot

 	For instance ATTG -> TTCA  Deciding which path to take while describing the longest path that also meets the rules of the presence of 
 					     TTGC   								ORF and an stop codon.

 						 
 Trimming 
 	R1 and R2 pass QC R1 and QC R2 (Paired)
 	If R1 or R2 are killed you need to located in QC S1 or QC S2 (unpaired)

 Probability error = 0.1
 	Then is transformed -10*log(base10)(probability error) = 10 and so on 


 #######Second week######
 Isoforms have different depth when mapped to the transcriptome

 In the transcriptome -> we do not have intergenic information (will generate more models)
 	Each isoforme will be its own reference
 	Multiple reads become multiappers then the quality of mapping of those go to 0

 Download the reference transcriptome of Nematostella vectensis
 	Index.
 		Aling reads
 Align the reads to the reference trancriptome
 Assing reads to genes
 Compare mapping efficiency between transcriptome and genome

 We do not have a GTF then we have to generate its own gtf
