##Running trimmomatic##
ILLUMINACLIP specifying the sequence of the adaptors  xyz (x number of mismatchs 2) (y = in pair end library it will trimm until it reaches a score of 30 it will be clipped) (z= score value for single end data)
LEADING and TRAILING remove low quality or N bases (below quality 3) 
SLIDINGWINDOW Scan the reads with a window of x and then if the quality goes below y remove (SLIDINGWINDOW 6:15) if the average quality falls bellow 15 which is basically 1 nucleotide per every 50bp (approximately). Everything that is from there on is trimmed 
MINLEN:75 Reads that should survive because if you keep shorter sequences

#NC_064034.1 Region to which the read was mapped

Where to check the flags from SAM files
https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/explain-flags.html (Second column)
The "=" means that they forward or reverse mapped to the same region
The fifth column gives the mapping quality, if 0 it means that is a multimapper and wont be included for further analysis
Optional fields nM: i: 2 number of matches 

##Retrieving sequences using samtools
#First do the index from .fasta
samtools faidx reference.fasta NC_064034.1:1500000-1501000  #The last parameter is the location of the sequence of interest 
#First do the index from .bam
samtools index SRR24348395Aligned.sortedByCoord.out.bam

#Checking the quality of the libraries using FASTQC
[barrera@login01 trim]$ module load fastqc
[barrera@login01 trim]$ fastqc -t 8 SRR24348395_R1.qc.fastq SRR24348395_R2.qc.fastq

#Taking files from the cluster
scp barrera@login01.lisc.univie.ac.at:/scratch/course/2023w300106/barrera/ex_5/SRR24348395/trim/SRR24348395_R2.qc_fastqc.html .
#Analyzong the fastqc
Per sequence GC content
  If there are two peaks it means that there is a signature of contamination with another organisms

##Day 3##
Generation of information about gene positions by mapping RNA-seq
  All reads belong to genes but you may not get all of the mRNAs: How to solve it? Different tissue/stages/deeper sequencing 
#If you have an argument in a program something like:
  <in.bam ...> #In this case we can input several files 
#In the case of stringtie it uses .bam files from RNA-seq to assemble those into potential transcripts 
  -g maximum gap allowed between read mappings (50) distance between the mappings - can be due low sequencing depth  (below this value it will be considered the same gene)
  -m the transcript length that can be accepted. It should be the size of at least one read (will use 150)
  -j how much evidence you need to merge two exons together  (1)
  -f isoforms  Proportion of read that should support a model in order to it be considered correct (default 0.01) if is present less than 100 down is ignored
  -M (Usually multimapped reads are not alllowed)
  -A gene abundance stimation output file

Stringtie merge

##Filtering of the .bam file##
Yesterday we saw that multimapping have quality of 0, then we will use -q 20 (1 in 100 probability of being wrong, i am keeping reads that have probability of 1% of being wrong)
Read should mapp into forward and reverse maps (if that is not the case we can exclude specific flags ) in this case we are requiring (0x2)
samtools view -b -o -q 20 /scratch/course/2023w300106/BAMS/SRR24348395.f.bam /scratch/course/2023w300106/barrera/ex4/SRR24348395_trim_Aligned.sortedByCoord.out.bam 

#Wildcard
*.bam -> This will match all files that finish in .bam
# dependency
sbatch --dependency=afterok: 9523010, xxxx, xxx myProgram.sh 

#Error in stringtie, there are not assigned strands to the reads

####Library normalization
It has to occur intra normalization which accounts for the size of the genes
Also occurs inter normalization 


###IGV
The IGV need to download the genome and the GTF too
## The distance in the gene models if supported it does not matter

#Coverage tells you info about the intergenic regions
#Junctions (It says which exons belong together to the same molecule)
Color of the junctions is indicating the strand 

#From the gene models you can compare sequences of proteins from different organisms

###Running augustus 
  #We split the genome
  #Samtools to extract chromosome sequences
